## 🧠 Available API Endpoints

| Endpoint         | Method | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`              | `GET`  | Health check (“Welcome to AgainBuilders”)                |
| `/auth/register` | `POST` | Register a new user                                      |
| `/auth/login`    | `POST` | Authenticate a user and get access token *(coming soon)* |

## 🔒 Security Practices

* Passwords are **hashed** using `bcrypt` via `passlib`.
* Tokens are **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) signed with your `SECRET_KEY`.
* `.env` file keeps all sensitive configuration outside your codebase.

---

## 🧪 Testing the API

FastAPI automatically generates documentation at:

* Swagger UI → [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
* ReDoc → [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

Build and run using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This launches both the FastAPI backend and a local database.
